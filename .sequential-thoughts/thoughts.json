There are multiple games in the /games directory\n4. I also see some content in /null-vesper which might be additional games or content\n5. There's an index.html that likely serves as the main page\n\nFor a comprehensive code audit, I need to:\n1. Identify all the games in the repository\n2. Examine each game's code structure\n3. Look for common issues like security vulnerabilities, performance problems, code quality issues\n4. Use the repl tools extensively as requested (10:1 ratio)\n5. Fix any issues found\n\nLet me start by cataloging all the games and understanding their structure.",
