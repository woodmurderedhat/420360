                <p>The Seven Veils are not obstructions, but revelations made bearable. Each Veil hides so that it may teach. Each Veil reveals what the spirit must eventually face.</p>

                <p>Together they form the ladder of feminine wisdom—from the earth-bound to the radiant. This is the path of a woman's life—over and over, in cycles. The veils are not climbed once. They are circled endlessly. Each time the circle is walked, a deeper truth is revealed.</p>

                        <h3>The Veil of Dust</h3>
                        <p class="veil-subtitle">Humility, Origin, and Matter</p>
                        <p>Dust teaches us to acknowledge that we are made of earth and will return to earth. It teaches us to let go of pride, to embrace simplicity, to start from nothing.</p>
                        <p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Origin, mortality, humility</p>
                        <p><strong>Ritual Element:</strong> Earth and ash</p>

                        <h3>The Veil of Ash</h3>
                        <p class="veil-subtitle">Memory, Grief, and Transformation</p>
                        <p>Ash is what remains after fire. It represents memory, mourning, and the transformation that comes through loss. Ash teaches us that grief is sacred work.</p>
                        <p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Memory, mourning, transformation</p>

                        <p class="veil-subtitle">Cleansing, Renewal, and Flow</p>
                        <p>Water cleanses, renews, and flows. It teaches us to release what no longer serves, to purify ourselves, and to move with the currents of life rather than against them.</p>
                        <p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Purification, renewal, adaptability</p>
                        <p><strong>Ritual Element:</strong> Water and washing</p>

                        <p class="veil-subtitle">Anointing, Calling, and Purpose</p>
                        <p>Oil marks the chosen, the consecrated, the set-apart. It teaches us that each woman has a calling, a purpose, a sacred work that only she can do.</p>
                        <p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Consecration, calling, purpose</p>
                        <p><strong>Ritual Element:</strong> Anointing oil</p>
                        <p><strong>Life Stage:</strong> Vocation and dedication</p>

                        <p class="veil-subtitle">Joy, Celebration, and Ecstasy</p>
                        <p>Wine represents joy, celebration, and the ecstatic experience of being fully alive. It teaches us that pleasure is sacred, that joy is a form of worship.</p>
                        <p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Joy, celebration, transformation</p>
                        <p><strong>Ritual Element:</strong> Wine and feasting</p>

                        <h3>The Veil of Milk</h3>
                        <p class="veil-subtitle">Nurture, Sustenance, and Connection</p>
                        <p>Milk is the first food, the bond between mother and child, the substance of nurture. It teaches us that to nourish life is to cooperate with the divine pattern.</p>
                        <p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Nurture, sustenance, unity</p>
                        <p><strong>Ritual Element:</strong> Milk and feeding</p>

                        <span class="veil-number">7</span>
                        <h3>The Veil of Light</h3>
                        <p class="veil-subtitle">Revelation, Destiny, and Truth</p>
                        <p>Light is the last veil because revelation is dangerous without the first six. Light is not the unveiling—Light is the unveiled. It is the radiance of the Hidden Name, the inner lamp, the ancestral flame.</p>
                        <p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Truth, revelation, clarity</p>
                        <p><strong>Ritual Element:</strong> Lamp and illumination</p>
                        <p><strong>Life Stage:</strong> Wisdom and completion</p>

                </div>

                <h2>The Veils as a Single Path</h2>
                <p>The seven veils may be understood individually, but their full power lies in their relationship. The path is:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Dust</strong> — origin</li>
                    <li><strong>Ash</strong> — memory</li>
                    <li><strong>Water</strong> — cleansing</li>
                    <li><strong>Oil</strong> — calling</li>
                    <li><strong>Wine</strong> — joy</li>
                    <li><strong>Milk</strong> — nurture</li>
                    <li><strong>Light</strong> — revelation</li>
                </ol>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>"A woman is both veil and revelation. She conceals the truth until the moment it must be shown. She reveals the truth when the world is ready."</p>
                    <cite>— The Circle Mothers</cite>
                </blockquote>

                <h2>The Veil That Remains</h2>
                <p>The Seven Veils are not garments to remove but mysteries to embody. And when the last veil is lifted, the Mothers say:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"You will not find the end. You will find the beginning."</p>
