[2025-04-11] Bugfix: Initial Tetrimino Display
- Fixed an issue where no tetrimino appeared on the board when starting the game.
- The game now draws the board and the first piece immediately after clicking "Start Game".

How to Play:
1. Enter your name and click "Start Game".
2. The board and the first tetrimino will appear.
3. Use the following controls:
   - A: Move left
   - D: Move right
   - S: Move down
   - W: Rotate
   - Space: Hard drop (if implemented)
   - C: Hold piece (if implemented)
4. Clear lines to score points. The game ends if pieces reach the top of the board.
