[2025-04-11] Refactored controls logic out of src/game.js into src/gameControls.js for better maintainability.
- All keyboard, mobile, and fullscreen controls are now handled in src/gameControls.js.
- This change is fully compatible with file:// loadingâ€”no server or CORS issues.
- index.html now loads src/gameControls.js before src/game.js.

Controls Instructions:
----------------------
Keyboard Controls:
- Move Left: ArrowLeft, A
- Move Right: ArrowRight, D
- Soft Drop: ArrowDown, S
- Hard Drop: Shift + ArrowDown
- Rotate: ArrowUp, W
- Hold Piece: Shift (not combined with ArrowDown)
- Play Tarot Card: 1-6 (number keys, if you have cards in hand)

Mobile Controls:
- Use the on-screen buttons below the game board for Left, Right, Down (hard drop), and Rotate.

Other:
- Fullscreen: Click the "Fullscreen" button in the footer.
- Arrow keys are prevented from scrolling the page.
- All controls work without needing to run a server.
