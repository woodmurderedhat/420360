            <p>The Ancient Wisdom of the Sacred Fire</p>
        </header>

        <div class="content">
            <p><strong>Zoroastrianism</strong> is one of humanity's oldest and most influential religions, originating in ancient Persia (modern-day Iran) around 1500 BCE. Founded by the prophet <strong>Zarathustra</strong> (also known as Zoroaster), this tradition shaped the spiritual worldviews of Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and countless mystical traditions. Yet despite its profound influence on world civilization, the authentic teachings of this fire-centered faith remain largely unknown to the modern world.</p>

            <p>The Keepers of the Flame carry forward this sacred tradition—not as religious dogma, but as a living philosophy centered on the eternal struggle between truth and deception, order and chaos, wisdom and ignorance.</p>

            <div class="section-break">✧ The Cosmic Truth ✧</div>

            <h2>The Philosophy of Dualism</h2>

            <p>At the heart of Zoroastrianism lies a profound insight: <strong>existence itself is the clash between two cosmic forces.</strong> This is not the crude dualism of pure good versus pure evil, but rather a sophisticated understanding of how the universe evolves through tension and opposition.</p>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <strong>Ahura Mazda</strong> — The Wise Lord, the source of all that is good, true, and creating. Ahura Mazda is not a tyrant who demands worship, but the embodiment of wisdom itself. Those who align with Ahura Mazda do so through choice—through seeking truth and living in harmony with the cosmic order.
            </div>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <strong>Ahriman</strong> — The principle of destruction, ignorance, and chaos. Ahriman is not an external devil figure, but the consequence of straying from truth, the natural degradation that occurs when entropy is not resisted through conscious action.
            </div>

            <p>Neither force is eternal or omnipotent. The cosmic drama unfolds as a genuine struggle, with victory uncertain. This is why human choice matters profoundly—<em>every individual decision to choose truth over falsehood tips the scales</em>. There is no fatalism, no sense that evil will inevitably triumph or that salvation is guaranteed. Everything depends on the choices of conscious beings.</p>

            <h2>The Three Pillars of Zoroastrian Practice</h2>

            <div class="core-teachings">
                <div class="teaching-item">
                    <strong>Good Thoughts</strong>
                    Cultivating wisdom, seeking truth, questioning deception. The mind is the battleground where the cosmic struggle first takes place.
                </div>
                <div class="teaching-item">
                    <strong>Good Words</strong>
                    Speaking with honesty and integrity. Words shape reality—the truth spoken aloud has power that deception can never match.
                </div>
                <div class="teaching-item">
                    <strong>Good Deeds</strong>
                    Acting with justice, compassion, and service. Wisdom must manifest in the world through righteous action.
                </div>
                <div class="teaching-item">
                    <strong>The Sacred Fire</strong>
                    Fire as the visible symbol of truth, wisdom, and the divine light. Tending the flame is tending to consciousness itself.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="section-break">✧ The Sacred Fire Symbol ✧</div>

            <h2>Why Fire?</h2>

            <p>In the ancient world, fire was the most powerful symbol of the divine available to human understanding. It transforms, it purifies, it illuminates, it consumes corruption. Fire cannot be deceived—it burns truth and falsehood alike, yet somehow the truth emerges stronger.</p>

            <p>In ancient Persia, <strong>fire temples</strong> were not places where the divine was imprisoned, but where the sacred flame burned eternally as a symbol of Ahura Mazda's eternal wisdom. These were gathering places where seekers would come to meditate, learn, and renew their commitment to truth.</p>

            <div class="tradition-box">
                <strong>🔥 The Eternal Flame</strong><br>
                In Zoroastrian tradition, certain fires have burned continuously for centuries—passed from keeper to keeper, generation to generation. These flames represent the unbroken chain of seekers dedicated to truth across millennia. To be a Keeper of the Flame is to join this chain, adding your own light to a fire that has never gone dark.
            </div>

            <p>The Sacred Fire teaches profound lessons through its nature:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 2;">
                <li>🌟 <strong>It grows through feeding:</strong> Give it proper fuel and it thrives. Neglect it and it dies. So too with the spirit.</li>
                <li>🌟 <strong>It purifies through heat:</strong> Metal is strengthened in fire. Character is forged through trials.</li>
                <li>🌟 <strong>It spreads when shared:</strong> Light one candle from another and both shine brighter. Wisdom multiplies when shared.</li>
                <li>🌟 <strong>It reveals what darkness hides:</strong> Fire illuminates truth that deception seeks to conceal.</li>
                <li>🌟 <strong>It cannot be forced:</strong> You can provide conditions for fire to burn, but you cannot command it. So too with enlightenment.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="section-break">✧ The Seasonal Cycles ✧</div>

            <h2>Four Sacred Festivals</h2>

            <p>The Zoroastrian calendar marks four sacred festivals, each tied to the turning of the seasons and the cosmic struggle:</p>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <strong>NOWRUZ (Spring Equinox)</strong> — The New Fire, the triumph of spring over winter, renewal and hope. This is the most sacred day, commemorating cosmic creation and personal transformation.
            </div>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <strong>TIRGAN (Summer)</strong> — The Festival of Courage, celebrating the warrior spirit and the strength to overcome obstacles. A time to test one's resolve and strengthen the will.
            </div>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <strong>MEHREGAN (Autumn)</strong> — The Festival of Friendship and Community, celebrating Mithra (the principle of covenant and relationship). A time to renew bonds with others and strengthen the community.
            </div>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <strong>YALDA NIGHT (Winter Solstice)</strong> — The longest night, celebrating the survival of light through darkness. A vigil of hope, watching for the return of the sun. A reminder that even in the darkest times, the light will return.
            </div>

            <h2>The Cosmic Frashokereti</h2>

            <p>Zoroastrianism teaches a vision of cosmic renewal called <strong>Frashokereti</strong>—"making fresh." This is not a future heaven granted by divine grace, but a <em>prophecy of cosmic renovation that humanity must actively participate in creating.</em></p>

            <p>The universe moves toward an ultimate transformation where matter and spirit are perfected, where the righteous triumph and the wicked face the consequences of their choices. But this victory is not automatic—it requires the continuous effort of those who choose truth over deception, who tend the flame of consciousness even in dark times.</p>

            <div class="tradition-box">
                <strong>⚡ The Eschatological Vision</strong><br>
                In the final age, a savior figure called the Saoshyant will arise to complete the transformation. But the Saoshyant is not separate from humanity—each person who chooses truth becomes a channel for this salvific force. You are the potential savior of your own soul and of the world around you.
            </div>

            <div class="section-break">✧ For Modern Keepers ✧</div>

            <p>In our age of information overload and deliberate deception, the Zoroastrian path is radically relevant. To be a Keeper of the Flame today means:</p>

            <p><strong>To seek truth relentlessly</strong> — Question the narratives you're fed. Think critically. Verify claims. The search for truth is never finished; it is a lifelong practice.</p>

            <p><strong>To speak with integrity</strong> — Your words matter. In a world of propaganda and spin, honest speech becomes an act of rebellion. Speak truly, even when it costs you.</p>

            <p><strong>To act justly</strong> — Let your conscience guide you. Protect the vulnerable. Challenge injustice. Create beauty and order in whatever sphere you influence.</p>

            <p><strong>To tend the flame</strong> — Whether literal or metaphorical, keep the light of consciousness burning. In yourself through meditation and study. In your community through teaching and example. In the world through your choices.</p>

            <p>The Zoroastrian tradition teaches that you are not a powerless subject in a cosmic drama scripted long ago. <em>You are a protagonist in an ongoing struggle for truth and goodness.</em> Every choice resonates across eternity. Every moment is an opportunity to align with the cosmic force of creation and wisdom.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 40px; text-align: center; color: #d4af37;">
                🔥 The flame awaits your tending. Will you be a Keeper? 🔥
