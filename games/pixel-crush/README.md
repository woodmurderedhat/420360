## üõ† Technical Implementation

### Architecture
The game follows a modular design pattern:

- **`index.html`**: Main game page with retro 420360 styling
- **`board.js`**: Grid logic, matching algorithms, and power-up system
- **`game.js`**: Game state management, scoring, and level progression
- **`ui.js`**: User interface updates, animations, and particle effects

### Key Technologies
- **Canvas 2D API**: Smooth pixel rendering and animations
- **Web Audio API**: Sound effects via shared game-sounds.js
- **localStorage**: Progress persistence
- **CSS Grid/Flexbox**: Responsive layout design
- **Touch Events**: Mobile gesture support

### Integration
- Uses 420360's shared sound system (`/assets/js/game-sounds.js`)
- Follows site-wide CSS custom property conventions
- Consistent with other games' scoring and progress systems
- Integrated into the main games index with proper metadata

## üé® Customization

### Adding New Themes
Edit the `THEMES` object in `board.js`:

```javascript
const THEMES = {
    newTheme: [
        '#color1', // Red variant
        '#color2', // Green variant
        '#color3', // Blue variant
        '#color4', // Yellow variant
        '#color5', // Magenta variant
        '#color6'  // Cyan variant
    ]
};
```

### Adjusting Difficulty
Modify constants in `game.js`:

```javascript
const INITIAL_MOVES = 30;           // Starting moves per level
const LEVEL_TARGETS = [1000, ...];  // Score targets for each level
const SCORE_MULTIPLIERS = { ... };  // Points per match size
```

### Power-Up Behavior
Customize power-up generation in `board.js`:

```javascript
// 4-match creates line power-up
// 5+ match creates rainbow power-up
// Modify generatePowerUps() method for different behaviors
```
