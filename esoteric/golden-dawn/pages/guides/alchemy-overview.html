        <h1>Alchemical Transmutation</h1>
        <h2 class="subtitle">The Four Stages of the Great Work</h2>

        <div class="overview">
            <h3>Understanding Alchemy</h3>
            <p>Alchemy is not the transformation of lead into gold (though that is its traditional description). True alchemy is the transformation of the human soul from its base, unrefined state into its highest, divine expression. The four stages—Nigredo, Albedo, Citrinitas, and Rubedo—correspond to psychological and spiritual development. They parallel the four elements and the entire journey of initiation.</p>
            <p><strong>Time Frame:</strong> The alchemical work may take years or even a lifetime. Patience is essential. One cannot rush the Great Work.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stage-box">
            <div class="stage-title">Stage 1: NIGREDO (The Blackening)</div>
            <p><strong>Element:</strong> Earth | <strong>Color:</strong> Black | <strong>Duration:</strong> Months to Years</p>
            <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> The initial putrefaction and dissolution of the base (unrefined) self. All that was built on false foundations falls away. Shadow aspects are revealed and confronted.</p>
            <p><strong>Psychological Correspondence:</strong> Confronting the shadow; facing one's darkest fears, shame, and denial. The "dark night of the soul" begins.</p>
            <p><strong>Practices:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Shadow work: Journal honestly about your character flaws</li>
                <li>Banishing rituals: Clear accumulated negative patterns</li>
                <li>Fasting and purification: Release old attachments</li>
                <li>Study of human darkness: Understand evil, hatred, and ignorance as facets of yourself</li>
                <li>Grounding practices: Accept your materiality and earthiness</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Completion Sign:</strong> You feel "broken open." Old self-image has dissolved. New ground is possible.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stage-box">
            <div class="stage-title">Stage 2: ALBEDO (The Whitening)</div>
            <p><strong>Element:</strong> Water | <strong>Color:</strong> White | <strong>Duration:</strong> Months to Years</p>
            <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> After the dissolution of Nigredo comes purification and washing clean. The soul is now receptive to new light. Innocence and clarity return.</p>
            <p><strong>Psychological Correspondence:</strong> Healing of wounds; development of compassion for yourself and others. The capacity to forgive and be forgiven emerges.</p>
            <p><strong>Practices:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Water purification: Ritual bathing, cleansing</li>
                <li>Forgiveness work: Forgive yourself and others completely</li>
                <li>Healing meditation: Restore emotional wholeness</li>
                <li>Middle Pillar practice: Balance all aspects of self</li>
                <li>Lunar work: Attune to receptivity, intuition, dreaming</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Completion Sign:</strong> Inner peace. A sense of "fresh beginning." Lightness and clarity return to your consciousness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stage-box">
            <div class="stage-title">Stage 3: CITRINITAS (The Yellowing)</div>
            <p><strong>Element:</strong> Air | <strong>Color:</strong> Yellow | <strong>Duration:</strong> Months to Years</p>
            <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Emergence of light and consciousness. Intellect awakens and develops. You begin to understand the hidden patterns and meanings in all things.</p>
            <p><strong>Psychological Correspondence:</strong> Mental clarity; development of wisdom and discrimination. You understand the "why" behind events. Knowledge becomes power.</p>
            <p><strong>Practices:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Study: Deep study of Hermetic philosophy, Kabbalah, sacred geometry</li>
                <li>Intellectual practices: Logic, debate, problem-solving applied spiritually</li>
                <li>Solar work: Attune to intellect, clarity, illumination</li>
                <li>Correspondence study: Understand hidden meanings in all symbols</li>
                <li>Teaching: Share knowledge with others—teaching solidifies understanding</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Completion Sign:</strong> A "eureka moment" of understanding. Life becomes intelligible. You see the order underlying apparent chaos.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stage-box">
            <div class="stage-title">Stage 4: RUBEDO (The Reddening)</div>
            <p><strong>Element:</strong> Fire | <strong>Color:</strong> Red/Gold | <strong>Duration:</strong> Years or Lifetime</p>
            <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> The final transformation into the completed work. The Philosopher's Stone is achieved. All elements are unified. The gold of divine consciousness manifests through your being.</p>
            <p><strong>Psychological Correspondence:</strong> Full integration and wholeness. All aspects of self—shadow, healed, wise, and divine—work as one unified consciousness. The Self is actualized.</p>
            <p><strong>Practices:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Integrated practice: All previous practices continue but in unified flow</li>
                <li>Fire of love: Work from the heart with compassion</li>
                <li>Creative manifestation: Create works of beauty and healing</li>
                <li>Ascended service: Serve humanity from your attainment</li>
                <li>God-consciousness: Live in continuous awareness of the Divine</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Completion Sign:</strong> You become the Philosopher's Stone—capable of healing others, transmuting darkness into light, blessing all you encounter.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="overview">
            <h3>The Cyclical Nature of Alchemy</h3>
            <p>These stages are not linear—they spiral. You may move through all four and then return to Nigredo at a deeper level, working through Albedo again with new understanding. Each cycle takes you deeper. The alchemical work is never truly "finished"—it is a lifetime journey of continuous refinement and integration.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> As above, so below. The transmutation happening within you mirrors the transmutation of the entire cosmos. You are simultaneously transforming yourself and participating in the transformation of all existence.</p>
