# Tarot Tetris Codebase Review & Improvement Suggestions

This document provides a comprehensive review of the Tarot Tetris codebase, focusing on code structure, maintainability, performance, and alignment with the intended game design. It also suggests concrete improvements and optimizations for each major area.

---

## 1. **Game Mechanics**

### **Current State**

* **Roguelike Loop & Persistence:** Gold is persistent via [localStorage](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/Stephanus/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html). Leveling up is the only way to earn gold.
* **Score & Gold:** Score is calculated per line, based on the tetrominoes in the cleared line, and multiplied by player level. Gold is awarded only on level up.
* **Upgrades:** Tetrominoes and game upgrades (combo, tarot chance, ghost piece, coyote time) are upgradable via the shop.
* **Tarot Cards:** Drawn only when a line is cleared, not on piece spawn.
* **Shop:** Contains standard and special tetrominoes, as well as game upgrades.

### **Suggestions**

* **Game Loop:** Consider extracting the main update loop and game state transitions into a dedicated controller module for clarity and easier testing.
* **Gold/Score Consistency:** Ensure all gold and score updates are routed through a single API (e.g., [TarotTetris.addGold](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/Stephanus/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html), [TarotTetris.addScore](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/Stephanus/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html)) to prevent desync.
* **Upgrade Effects:** Centralize upgrade effect application (e.g., combo multiplier, tarot chance) in a single place (e.g., after loading upgrades or after purchase) to avoid scattered logic.
* **Tarot Draw Logic:** Make the tarot draw chance and logic more explicit and configurable, possibly as a function of upgrade level.

## 2. **Shop System**

### **Current State**

* **UI:** Shop is a modal overlay with tabs for Tetriminos and Upgrades, and sub-tabs for Standard/Special pieces.
* **Upgrades:** Each upgrade has a max level, cost scaling, and effect function.
* **Persistence:** Upgrade levels and unlocked pieces are saved to [localStorage](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/Stephanus/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html).
* **Feedback:** Buttons provide visual feedback on success/failure.

### **Suggestions**

* **UI/UX:**
  * Add tooltips or info icons for upgrades and pieces to explain their effects.
  * Show current gold and upgrade costs more prominently.
  * Consider adding a confirmation dialog for expensive purchases.
* **Code:**
  * Refactor shop logic into smaller modules: UI rendering, state management, and persistence.
  * Use a single source of truth for upgrade levels and unlocked pieces (avoid duplicating state between [window](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/Stephanus/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) and shop module).
  * Add error handling for [localStorage](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/Stephanus/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) failures.
* **Performance:**
  * Minimize full UI re-renders; update only changed elements after a purchase/upgrade.
* **Extensibility:**
  * Define upgrades and pieces in a data-driven way (e.g., JSON or config object), making it easier to add new content.

---

## 3. **Sound System**

### **Current State**

* **Sound Effects:** Mapped to game events via [SOUND_EFFECTS](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/Stephanus/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) and [DEFAULT_SOUND_MAPPINGS](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/Stephanus/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html).
* **Music:** Automatically cycles through all tracks in the [music](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/Stephanus/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) directory.
* **Settings:** Volume and mute toggles for music and sound effects, persisted in [localStorage](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/Stephanus/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html).
* **Event Handling:** Listens for all major game events and plays appropriate sounds.

### **Suggestions**

* **Performance:**
  * Preload all sound files at initialization to avoid latency on first play.
  * Use the Web Audio API for more advanced effects (e.g., fading, pitch changes).
* **UX:**
  * Add visual feedback for sound settings (e.g., mute icon, volume slider value).
  * Allow users to skip or replay tracks from the pause menu.
* **Code:**
  * Refactor event listener setup to be more declarative (e.g., a mapping of event names to sound handlers).
  * Consider supporting custom sound packs by allowing users to drop in new files and map them via a config UI.

## 4. **UI/UX**

### **Current State**

* **Overlays:** Modular overlays for intro, pause, objectives, and game over.
* **Panels:** Floating objectives panel, hold/next panels, and mobile controls.
* **Accessibility:** Uses `aria-live` and labels for screen readers.
* **Responsiveness:** CSS includes mobile-friendly adjustments.

### **Suggestions**

* **Accessibility:**
  * Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard-navigable.
  * Add focus outlines and skip-to-content links.
* **Mobile:**
  * Optimize touch controls for smaller screens (larger buttons, spacing).
  * Consider haptic feedback for mobile actions.
* **Visuals:**
  * Add subtle animations for level up, gold gain, and tarot effects.
  * Use consistent color schemes and iconography across overlays and panels.
* **Performance:**
  * Debounce rapid UI updates (e.g., score/gold) to avoid layout thrashing.

---

## 5. **Code Structure & Maintainability**

### **Current State**

* **Modularity:** Each major system (game, shop, sound, overlays) is in its own file.
* **Globals:** Some state is managed via [window](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/Stephanus/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) properties, which can lead to conflicts.
* **Event System:** Custom event system for decoupling modules.

### **Suggestions**

* **Encapsulation:**
  * Minimize use of global variables; prefer module-scoped state and explicit exports.
  * Use a central game state object (e.g., [TarotTetris.state](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/Stephanus/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html)) for all persistent and runtime state.
* **Type Safety:**
  * Consider adding JSDoc comments or migrating to TypeScript for better type checking.
* **Testing:**
  * Add unit tests for core logic (scoring, upgrades, tarot effects).
  * Use the included [soundTest.html](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/Stephanus/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) for regression testing of audio.
* **Documentation:**
  * Expand inline documentation, especially for public APIs and event contracts.
  * Maintain a changelog for major gameplay and system changes.

---

## 6. **Performance Optimizations**

* **Rendering:** Only redraw changed parts of the board/UI when possible.
* **Sound:** Batch sound effect triggers if multiple events fire in a single frame.
* **Storage:** Debounce [localStorage](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/Stephanus/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) writes to avoid excessive disk access.

---

## 7. **Feature Suggestions & Roadmap**

* **Achievements:** Add unlockable achievements for milestones (e.g., high score, all upgrades).
* **Daily Challenges:** Introduce rotating objectives for replayability.
* **Replay System:** Allow players to watch replays or share seeds.
* **Cloud Save:** Optionally sync gold/upgrades via a backend for cross-device play.
