[2025-04-11] Bugfix: Initial Tetrimino Display
- Fixed an issue where no tetrimino appeared on the board when starting the game.
- The game now draws the board and the first piece immediately after clicking "Start Game".

[2025-04-11] Bugfix: Canvas ID Mismatch
- Fixed a critical bug where the game would not render because the JavaScript was looking for a canvas with id "game-canvas" instead of "tetris".
- The game now correctly finds the canvas and displays the board and pieces.

How to Play:
1. Enter your name and click "Start Game".
2. The board and the first tetrimino will appear.
3. Use the following controls:
   - Arrow Keys: Move the piece (Left, Right, Down)
   - Arrow Up / W: Rotate the piece
   - Shift: Hold the current piece
   - Number Keys (1-6): Activate tarot cards (if available)
4. Clear lines to score points. The game ends if pieces reach the top of the board.
5. Use tarot cards for special abilities (see the Tarot Cards section in the game for details).
