                    <p>Every woman bears three names.<br>
                    One is spoken by the world.<br>
                    One is spoken by those she loves.<br>

                <h2>The Three Names</h2>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>The First Name: The Garment</h3>
                    <p>The first name is spoken by the world. It is the name given at birth, the name on documents, the name by which society knows you. This is the garment—necessary, visible, but not the essence.</p>
                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Social identity and worldly function</p>
                    <p><strong>Nature:</strong> Public, changeable, external</p>
                    <p><strong>Teaching:</strong> "The world names you by what it sees, not by what you are."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>The Second Name: The Bond</h3>
                    <p>The second name is spoken by those you love. It may be a nickname, a term of endearment, a private name known only to family and close friends. This is the bond—intimate, relational, revealing connection.</p>
                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Relational identity and belonging</p>
                    <p><strong>Nature:</strong> Private, affectionate, chosen</p>
                    <p><strong>Teaching:</strong> "Love names you by what it cherishes, not by what you do."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>The Third Name: The Root</h3>
                    <p>The third name is the Hidden Name, spoken only by the Mother of Mothers. It is the name of your soul, your essence, your true purpose. This name cannot be stolen, cannot be changed, cannot be diminished. It is the root that anchors the entire tree.</p>
                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Spiritual identity and destiny</p>
                    <p><strong>Nature:</strong> Sacred, eternal, essential</p>
                    <p><strong>Teaching:</strong> "The Divine names you by what you truly are, beyond all masks."</p>
                </div>

                <h2>The Doctrine of the Hidden Name</h2>

                <p>To know a woman's Hidden Name is to know:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The truth the world cannot steal</li>
                    <li>The wound the world cannot inflict</li>
                    <li>The purpose the world cannot hinder</li>
                    <li>The strength the world cannot diminish</li>
                    <li>The beauty the world cannot corrupt</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Journey to the Hidden Name</h2>

                <p>The Hidden Name is not given at birth. It is discovered through the journey of the Seven Veils. Each veil reveals a layer of truth about who you are:</p>

                <h2>The Naming Ceremony</h2>

                <p>When an initiate completes the journey through the Seven Veils, she participates in the Naming Ceremony. This sacred rite takes place at night, under the full moon, in the presence of the Circle Mothers.</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>The Ceremony</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The initiate enters the circle in silence</li>
                        <li>She speaks her first name (the garment) and removes her outer cloak</li>
                        <li>She speaks her second name (the bond) and is embraced by the Mothers</li>
                        <li>She sits in meditation while the Mothers chant</li>
                        <li>The Mother of Veils whispers the Hidden Name into her ear</li>
                        <li>The initiate lights her own lamp, symbolizing her inner light</li>
                        <li>She is welcomed as a full member of the Order</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <h2>The Power of the Hidden Name</h2>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>"When you know your Hidden Name, you cannot be unmade. When you speak your Hidden Name, you cannot be silenced. When you live your Hidden Name, you cannot be defeated."</p>
                    <cite>— The Book of Hidden Names</cite>
                </blockquote>

                <p>The Hidden Name is not meant to be spoken aloud except in the most sacred moments. It is a name you carry in your heart, a truth you embody in your life, a light you shine through your actions.</p>

                <h2>Names in the Tradition</h2>

                <p>Throughout the history of the Order, certain Hidden Names have been recorded (with permission) as examples of the types of names revealed:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>She Who Remembers</strong> — A keeper of ancestral memory</li>
                    <li><strong>Lamp in Darkness</strong> — One who brings hope in despair</li>
                    <li><strong>Voice of the Silenced</strong> — One who speaks for the voiceless</li>
                    <li><strong>Weaver of Broken Threads</strong> — One who repairs what is torn</li>
                    <li><strong>Guardian of Thresholds</strong> — One who protects transitions</li>
                    <li><strong>Keeper of the Flame</strong> — One who preserves sacred fire</li>
                    <li><strong>Dancer Between Worlds</strong> — One who bridges realms</li>
                </ul>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>"Your Hidden Name is not what you are called. It is what you are."</p>
