[2025-04-12] Fixed ReferenceError in "The Hanged Man" tarot card effect.
- The effect now uses TarotTetris.dropInterval and TarotTetris.setGameSpeed to adjust game speed, matching the rest of the codebase.
- This prevents errors when playing "The Hanged Man" card.

How "The Hanged Man" tarot card works:
- When played, the game speed (piece drop interval) is drastically slowed for 10 seconds, making pieces fall much slower.
- After 10 seconds, the game speed returns to its previous value.

To play a tarot card:
- Click a tarot card in your hand (displayed at the bottom of the game UI).
- The card's effect will activate immediately and be logged in the game info panel.

- Added a gold info section to the pause menu explaining the new system

### 3. Line Score Calculation Improved
