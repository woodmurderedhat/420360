[2025-04-11] Refactored tarot logic out of src/game.js into src/tarot.js.

- All tarot deck, hand, effects, and tarot-related functions are now in src/tarot.js.
- index.html loads src/tarot.js before src/game.js, so all tarot logic is available globally.
- game.js now references the global tarot functions/variables (e.g., addTarotCardToHand, playTarotCard, updateTarotUI, etc.).
- No import/export or modules are used, so the game works when opening index.html directly (no server or CORS issues).

Instructions for tarot logic:
- Tarot cards are drawn and managed via the global tarotDeck and playerHand.
- Tarot card effects are defined in the global tarotEffects object.
- To add new tarot cards or effects, edit src/tarot.js.
- Tarot UI and card play logic are handled by updateTarotUI and playTarotCard, also in src/tarot.js.

This refactor keeps game.js smaller and makes tarot logic easier to maintain.
