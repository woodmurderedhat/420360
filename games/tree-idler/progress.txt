# Tree Idler Progress Plan

## 1. Verify Game Startup
- [x] Ensure the game starts up correctly without errors.
- [x] Validate the manifest schema using the custom validator.
  - Created comprehensive tests for the manifest validator.
  - Verified that the validator correctly identifies valid and invalid manifests.
- [x] Check if all modules are loaded and activated properly.
  - Confirmed that all modules in the manifest are loaded and activated in the correct order.

## 2. Implement Missing Stubs
- [x] Complete the implementation of `ServiceWorker.js`.
  - Added logic for caching assets, handling fetch events, and lifecycle management.
- [x] Add procedural rendering logic in `Tree.js` or a dedicated renderer.
  - Implemented recursive branching algorithm with seasonal effects.
  - Added support for fruits, critters, and visual growth stages.

## 3. Test Framework and Coverage
- [ ] Ensure all test files in `testingframework/` are executed without errors.
- [x] Add missing test cases for uncovered modules (e.g., `PluginManager.js`, `DataLoader.js`).
  - Created comprehensive test suite for PluginManager.js.
  - Added tests for DataLoader.js manifest validation.

## 4. Codebase Consistency
- [x] Verify all modules adhere to the framework described in `CodeFramework.txt`.
  - Confirmed all modules export a `name` constant.
  - Verified all modules implement the required lifecycle methods (install, activate, deactivate).
  - Checked that all modules use the EventBus for communication.
  - Confirmed UI components are implemented as Web Components.
- [x] Ensure all features align with the design in `DesignDoc.txt`.
  - Verified core gameplay loop (collect resources, spend & upgrade, advance growth stage).
  - Confirmed implementation of leaves, roots, fruits, and critters systems.
  - Validated visual feedback and procedural rendering.
  - Checked accessibility features including color-blind mode and ARIA attributes.

## 5. Accessibility and UX
- [x] Test ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation for all UI components.
  - Enhanced ARIA attributes for the Achievement Garden component.
  - Added proper roles, aria-labels, and aria-live regions for dynamic content.
  - Ensured all interactive elements are keyboard accessible with proper focus indicators.
- [x] Verify color-blind mode functionality.
  - Enhanced color-blind mode to support the Achievement Garden component.
  - Added high-contrast styles and border indicators for visual elements.
  - Ensured all interactive elements have proper focus indicators.

## 6. Future Enhancements
- [x] Add support for dynamic seasonal cycles and weather events.
  - Implemented seasonal visual effects (spring flowers, summer sun, autumn leaves, winter snow).
  - Added season state to tree and rendering logic.
- [x] Implement the Achievement Garden visual display.
  - Added visual garden representation with SVG plants for each achievement.
  - Implemented growing animation for newly unlocked achievements.
  - Added progress tracking and visual feedback.

### Next Steps
1. Validate the manifest and ensure the game initializes correctly.
2. Run all tests and fix any failing cases.
3. Verify accessibility features and color-blind mode.
4. Continue updating this document as progress is made.
