                <h2>Who Are the Circle Mothers?</h2>

                <p>The Circle Mothers are the experienced teachers and wisdom keepers of the Order. They are women who have completed the journey through the Seven Veils and dedicated themselves to guiding others on the path.</p>

                <p>They are called "Circle Mothers" because they sit in circle—no hierarchy of position, only the equality of shared wisdom. Each Mother brings her unique gifts, experiences, and insights to the teaching.</p>

                <h2>The Role of Circle Mothers</h2>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Teachers and Guides</h3>
                    <p>Circle Mothers guide initiates through the Seven Veils, offering wisdom, support, and challenge at each stage of the journey. They know when to comfort and when to confront, when to speak and when to listen.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Keepers of Oral Tradition</h3>
                    <p>They preserve the stories, teachings, and genealogies of the Order through oral transmission. They memorize the sacred texts, the ritual instructions, and the histories of the Hidden Sisters.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Ritual Leaders</h3>
                    <p>Circle Mothers lead the ceremonies of the Order—births, namings, initiations, mournings, and celebrations. They know the proper forms, the sacred words, and the traditional gestures.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Counselors and Mediators</h3>
                    <p>They offer counsel in times of difficulty, mediate conflicts within the community, and provide spiritual guidance for life's challenges.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Guardians of the Calendar</h3>
                    <p>They maintain the sacred calendar, marking the festivals, the moon cycles, and the appropriate times for various rituals and gatherings.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>The Teachings of the Circle Mothers</h2>

                <p>The Circle Mothers have preserved countless teachings through the generations. Here are some of their core wisdom sayings:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>"A woman is both veil and revelation. She conceals the truth until the moment it must be shown. She reveals the truth when the world is ready."</p>
                </blockquote>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>"Truth must come veiled, or the unready will be blinded."</p>
                </blockquote>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>"The world names you by what it sees, not by what you are. Love names you by what it cherishes, not by what you do. The Divine names you by what you truly are, beyond all masks."</p>
                </blockquote>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>"Grief is not weakness. Grief is the price of love, and love is the work of the Divine."</p>
                </blockquote>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>"Every ritual is a doorway. Every gesture is a prayer. Every gathering is a remembering."</p>
                </blockquote>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>"When you know your Hidden Name, you cannot be unmade. When you speak your Hidden Name, you cannot be silenced. When you live your Hidden Name, you cannot be defeated."</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h2>Becoming a Circle Mother</h2>

                <p>Not all who complete the Seven Veils become Circle Mothers. The role requires a specific calling and additional preparation:</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>The Requirements</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Completion of the Seven Veils journey</li>
                        <li>Recognition of the teaching gift by current Circle Mothers</li>
                        <li>Apprenticeship with an experienced Mother for at least one full year</li>
                        <li>Memorization of core texts and ritual forms</li>

                        <li>Acceptance by the circle through consensus</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <h2>The Circle Mother's Vow</h2>

                <p>When a woman is accepted as a Circle Mother, she makes this vow before the assembly:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>"I vow to keep the lamp burning,<br>
                    to preserve the stories,<br>
                    to guide the seekers,<br>
                    to honor the ancestors,<br>
                    to speak truth with compassion,<br>
                    to hold space for grief and joy,<br>
                    to guard the sacred mysteries,<br>
                    and to serve the circle with my whole heart."</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h2>The Seven Types of Circle Mothers</h2>

                <p>While all Circle Mothers share core responsibilities, each often develops a particular area of expertise corresponding to one of the Seven Veils:</p>

                </div>

                <h2>The First Mother</h2>

                <p>According to tradition, there was a First Mother of the Circle whose true name is lost to time. She is said to have established the core teachings and the structure of the Seven Veils.</p>

                <p>Some say she came from the lineage of midwives who traveled with the tribes. Some say she was a mourner who learned to shape grief into guidance. Others claim she was born in Shiloh, where the dancing maidens kept the rhythm of the seasons.</p>

                <p>What is known is that she gathered women around her, taught them the mysteries, and sent them out to form new circles. Her legacy lives on in every Circle Mother who sits in the teaching circle today.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>"The First Mother taught: 'I am not the beginning. I am only the one who remembered.'"</p>
