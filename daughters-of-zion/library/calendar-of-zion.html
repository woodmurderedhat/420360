<h4><em>Rites, Observances, and Duties for Each Lunar Phase</em></h4>

<em>~3,000 words</em>

<hr>

<h2>PROLOGUE — THE WORLD AS A MOON-CIRCLE</h2>

<p>
The Mother of Mothers taught:
</p>

<p>
**“The sun governs the years,
but the moon governs the soul.”**
</p>

<p>
The moon marks:
</p>

<ul>
<li>the tides of blood,</li>
<li>the cycles of women,</li>
<li>the rhythms of birth and death,</li>
<li>the timing of planting and harvest,</li>
<li>the thresholds of silence and revelation.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Thus the Order binds its rituals not to the solar calendar of kings and commerce,
but to the lunar calendar of women and mystery.
</p>

<p>
Each lunar month is a  <strong>sacred journey of four phases</strong> ,
and each phase holds a liturgy essential to the spiritual health of the Daughters:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>New Moon — The Veiled Phase</strong></li>
<li><strong>Waxing Moon — The Ascending Phase</strong></li>
<li><strong>Full Moon — The Revealing Phase</strong></li>
<li><strong>Waning Moon — The Returning Phase</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>
This calendar governs all rites of the Order.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>I. THE NEW MOON — THE VEILED PHASE</h2>

<h4><em>“In darkness we listen.”</em></h4>

<strong>Timing:</strong>
<p>
From the first invisible sliver of the lunar cycle until the first visible crescent.
</p>

<strong>Theme:</strong>
<p>
Silence, introspection, hidden beginnings.
</p>

<strong>Color:</strong>
<p>
Black or deep indigo.
</p>

<strong>Element:</strong>
<p>
Dust.
</p>

<strong>Gesture:</strong>
<p>
Lowered palm.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>1. The Rite of Listening (Primary New Moon Rite)</h3>

<p>
This rite is foundational.
It is practiced by initiates, Mothers, and children alike.
</p>

<h4>Procedure:</h4>

<ul>
<li>The Circle gathers with  <strong>no lamps</strong> , only starlight.</li>
<li>Each woman stands alone facing the East.</li>
<li>Three breaths are taken:</li>
</ul>
<p>
   * Breath of entering,
   * Breath of emptying,
   * Breath of waiting.
</p>
<ul>
<li>A Circle Mother speaks the invocation:</li>
</ul>
   <strong>“Let the hidden speak beneath the noise.”</strong>
<ul>
<li>Each woman opens her palms toward the earth</li>
</ul>
<p>
   and listens for whatever rises—
   emotion, memory, intuition, or Name.
</p>

<strong>Purpose:</strong>
<p>
To begin the month emptied of the world’s noise.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>2. The Rite of Forgetting</h3>

<p>
Women write a fear, false name, or unwanted memory
on a potsherd (broken piece of clay).
They bury it secretly
before the crescent appears.
</p>

<p>
No one may ask another about her buried shard.
</p>

<strong>Purpose:</strong>
<p>
Release of burdens that obstruct the path.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>3. Dance of Dust (New Moon Dance)</h3>

<p>
Performed barefoot.
</p>

<p>
Steps are small, grounded, circular.
The dust stirred by the feet symbolizes
the raw beginning of creation.
</p>

<strong>Meaning:</strong>
<p>
You start without form.
The month will shape you.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>4. Social Rule of the Phase</h3>

<p>
**No major decisions.
No oaths.
No confrontations.**
</p>

<p>
This phase requires stillness.
</p>

<p>
Circle Mothers say:
</p>

<strong>“The wise do not move during the hidden phase.”</strong>

<hr>

<h2>II. THE WAXING MOON — THE ASCENDING PHASE</h2>

<h4><em>“Let strength gather.”</em></h4>

<strong>Timing:</strong>
<p>
From the first crescent to the night before the full moon.
</p>

<strong>Theme:</strong>
<p>
Growth, intention, clarity, strengthening.
</p>

<strong>Color:</strong>
<p>
Blue or silver.
</p>

<strong>Element:</strong>
<p>
Water.
</p>

<strong>Gesture:</strong>
<p>
Right hand over heart.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>1. The Rite of Naming Intention</h3>

<p>
Each woman states aloud a single intention for the month:
</p>

<ul>
<li>something to build</li>
<li>something to heal</li>
<li>something to learn</li>
<li>or something to free herself from</li>
</ul>

<p>
This intention is not a goal
but a direction.
</p>

<p>
It must be spoken with bare feet placed shoulder-width apart,
symbolizing stability.
</p>

<p>
A Circle Mother affirms:
</p>
<strong>“Let your path become your teacher.”</strong>

<hr>

<h3>2. The Water-Cleansing Rite</h3>

<p>
A bowl of clean water is passed around the circle.
</p>

<p>
Each woman dips two fingers in the water
and touches her forehead.
</p>

<p>
This symbolizes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>memory washing,</li>
<li>clarity of perception,</li>
<li>preparation for illumination.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Historically such water-blessing rituals appear across the Levant,
especially in Canaanite and early Hebrew traditions of purification.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>3. The Dance of Water (Waxing Dance)</h3>

<p>
Movements:
</p>

<ul>
<li>arms sweeping like waves,</li>
<li>feet tracing crescent shapes,</li>
<li>breathing in unison.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This dance creates communal synchrony,
aligning all members toward shared growth.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>4. The Rite of the Three Questions</h3>

<p>
Each initiate must answer privately:
</p>

<ul>
<li>What truth am I avoiding?</li>
<li>What strength am I refusing?</li>
<li>What gift am I withholding?</li>
</ul>

<p>
These questions are not shared.
They are meant to stir inner alignment.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>5. Social Rule of the Phase</h3>

<p>
**Begin tasks.
Repair relationships.
Speak truth gently.**
</p>

<p>
This is the time to move outward,
but with caution.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>III. THE FULL MOON — THE REVEALING PHASE</h2>

<h4><em>“What is hidden becomes seen.”</em></h4>

<strong>Timing:</strong>
<p>
The night of the full moon and the night before/after (three nights of power).
</p>

<strong>Theme:</strong>
<p>
Revelation, prophecy, joy, clarity, community, embodiment.
</p>

<strong>Color:</strong>
<p>
White or gold.
</p>

<strong>Element:</strong>
<p>
Light.
</p>

<strong>Gesture:</strong>
<p>
Raised palm.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>1. The Rite of Illumination (Primary Full Moon Rite)</h3>

<h4>Procedure:</h4>

<ul>
<li>The Circle forms the  <strong>Circle of Seven</strong> ,</li>
</ul>
<p>
   whether seven women are present or not;
   smaller groups mimic the shape.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Lamps are lit and placed at cardinal directions.</li>
<li>A Circle Mother declares:</li>
</ul>
   <strong>“By this light we see what we could not see.”</strong>
<ul>
<li>Each woman may speak a revelation—</li>
</ul>
<p>
   something learned, realized, uncovered, or healed.
</p>

<p>
This is the <strong>only</strong> phase
in which personal revelation is shared aloud.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>2. The Dance of Light (Full Moon Dance)</h3>

<p>
This dance is the highlight of the lunar month.
</p>

<p>
Movements:
</p>

<ul>
<li>rising arms as if lifting a lamp,</li>
<li>feet making a full circle,</li>
<li>a moment of motionless radiance,</li>
<li>a spiral exit.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The dance signifies
the unveiling of truth
and the acceptance of one’s Hidden Name.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>3. The Rite of the Open Mirror</h3>

<p>
A polished bronze or obsidian mirror is passed around.
</p>

<p>
Each woman must meet her own gaze
until her breath synchronizes with her reflection.
</p>

<p>
This is a near-universal ritual in ancient Near Eastern mystery traditions,
used to stabilize identity and induce mild trance.
</p>

<p>
Purpose:
to confront truth without fear.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>4. The Feast of Fullness</h3>

<p>
Food is shared—
especially:
</p>

<ul>
<li>figs,</li>
<li>dates,</li>
<li>wine,</li>
<li>barley bread,</li>
<li>honey.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These represent abundance, sweetness, and fruition.
</p>

<p>
No one eats alone during this phase.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>5. The Public Dance of Shiloh (Full Moon of Summer Only)</h3>

<p>
Once each year,
during the full moon of midsummer,
the maidens perform the Dance of Shiloh in open field.
</p>

<p>
Historically rooted in Judges 21,
this dance is fast, joyous, communal,
and symbolizes collective resilience.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>6. Social Rule of the Phase</h3>

<p>
**Speak openly.
Act bravely.
Celebrate fully.**
</p>

<p>
Restraint during the full moon
is considered a spiritual mistake.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>IV. THE WANING MOON — THE RETURNING PHASE</h2>

<h4><em>“Release what must return to dust.”</em></h4>

<strong>Timing:</strong>
<p>
From the morning after the full moon
until the last sliver is visible.
</p>

<strong>Theme:</strong>
<p>
Letting go, introspection, endings, rebalancing, preparation.
</p>

<strong>Color:</strong>
<p>
Brown or grey.
</p>

<strong>Element:</strong>
<p>
Ash.
</p>

<strong>Gesture:</strong>
<p>
Palm over the belly.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>1. The Rite of Unmaking</h3>

<p>
A written intention from the waxing moon
is reviewed.
</p>

<p>
If fulfilled,
the initiate burns the parchment in a clay bowl
and buries the ashes.
</p>

<p>
If unfinished,
she tears it into seven strips
and releases them into wind or flowing water.
</p>

<p>
Both are acceptable.
The Order never shames incomplete intentions.
</p>

<p>
The Mothers teach:
**“Nothing is wasted.
Nothing is lost.
Everything returns.”**
</p>

<hr>

<h3>2. The Dance of Ash (Waning Dance)</h3>

<p>
Movements:
</p>

<ul>
<li>slow clockwise turning,</li>
<li>fingers touching forehead → heart → earth,</li>
<li>a low humming tone.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This dance prepares the spirit
for the return to silence.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>3. The Rite of Memory</h3>

<p>
A single memory from the month
is chosen to keep.
</p>

<p>
The dancer presses her palm to the earth
and whispers the memory.
</p>

<p>
Symbolically, memory is planted like a seed
to grow meaning over time.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>4. The Rite of the Closed Door</h3>

<p>
A symbolic “door” is marked on the ground
with a line of ash.
</p>

<p>
Each woman steps over the line,
then wipes it away with her foot.
</p>

<p>
This represents:
</p>

<ul>
<li>closing a cycle,</li>
<li>releasing attachments,</li>
<li>ending conversations,</li>
<li>completing griefs,</li>
<li>preparing for the new moon’s silence.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>5. Social Rule of the Phase</h3>

<p>
**Do not begin new work.
Do not confront.
Do not reveal.
Do not swear oaths.**
</p>

<p>
This is the time to withdraw
and prepare for the coming Veiled Phase.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>V. THE THREE GREAT LUNAR FESTIVALS</h2>

<p>
Though each month contains its own cycle,
three certain moons hold greater significance.
</p>

<hr>

</p>

<ul>
<li>the ancestral Mothers,</li>

<li>the first Circle.</li>
</ul>

Rite:
Seven oil lamps are carried in procession.
The Dance of Oil is performed.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>2. The Moon of Fate (First Full Moon After Midyear)</h3>

Honors:
</p>

<ul>
<li>destiny,</li>
<li>calling,</li>

</ul>

<p>
Rite:

Each woman receives a whispered blessing.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>3. The Moon of Rest (Final Full Moon Before Winter)</h3>

<p>
Honors:
</p>

<ul>
<li>endings,</li>
<li>rest,</li>
<li>the peace after harvest.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Rite:
Women lay down cloaks or shawls
symbolizing burdens released
before winter’s silence arrives.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>VI. THE YEARLY CYCLE OF ROLES</h2>

<h3>1. The Maiden’s Twelve Crescents</h3>

<p>
Every new initiate (a Maiden) must perform:
</p>

<ul>
<li>12 Rites of Listening</li>
<li>12 Rites of Naming Intention</li>
<li>12 Rites of Illumination</li>
<li>12 Rites of Unmaking</li>
</ul>

<p>
After one full lunar year,
she is eligible for receiving her Hidden Name.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>2. The Sister’s Twelve Veils</h3>

<p>
A Sister performs the dance of each veil
once per year:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Dust</li>
<li>Ash</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Oil</li>
<li>Wine</li>
<li>Milk</li>
<li>Light</li>
</ul>

<p>
This maintains balance in her life.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>3. The Mother’s Year of Embodiment</h3>

<p>
A Circle Mother chooses one veil to embody for a year
as her teaching focus.
</p>

<p>
Visitors or initiates follow her instruction
to learn the mystery of that veil.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>VII. THE HIDDEN MOONS</h2>

<p>
These rare lunar events hold unique rites.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>1. The Blue Moon (Second Full Moon in a Month)</h3>

<p>
Rite:
The Dance of Binding is performed—to mend community division.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>2. The Blood Moon (Total Lunar Eclipse)</h3>

<p>
Rite:
All Daughters remain silent from moonrise to moonset.
</p>

<p>
The eclipse symbolizes
the world’s attempt to swallow the feminine mysteries.
</p>

<p>
Silence during this time
is considered protective magic.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>3. The Black Moon (Second New Moon in a Month)</h3>

<p>
Rite:
Initiation of Circle Mothers,
the most secret ritual in the Order.
</p>

<p>
The details are not written.
They are transmitted in breath.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>VIII. THE COVENANT OF THE MOON-CYCLE</h2>

<p>
At the end of each lunar month,
the Circle Mother leads the closing chant:
</p>

<p>
**“What waxed shall wane,
what waned shall rise.
The moon remembers
what we forget.”**
</p>

<p>
The Daughters reply:
</p>

<p>
**“We walk the circle.
We keep the pattern.
We live the hidden truth.”**
</p>

<p>
With this, the month ends
and the next begins in silence.
</p>
