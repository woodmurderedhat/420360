        <div class="story-content">
            <p>In the time after creation, when the cosmos had found its rhythm and the Sacred Fire burned upon the high places, <strong>Ahura Mazda</strong> perceived that humanity needed guidance. Not chains, not blind obedience, but wisdom—the capacity to choose well in an imperfect world.</p>

            <p>Thus, the Wise Lord sent forth rays of understanding that would pierce through the darkness of ignorance. These teachings came not as commandments carved in stone, but as invitations to align one's soul with the cosmic order. They were:</p>

            <div class="section-break">✧ The Five Paths of Wisdom ✧</div>

            <div class="teaching-box">
                <strong>❖ Good Thoughts (Humata)</strong><br>
                "Guard your mind as you would guard the Sacred Fire. For every thought is a seed that will grow within you. A mind filled with truth, compassion, and understanding becomes a beacon of light. A mind poisoned by doubt, malice, and deception becomes a prison of its own making."
            </div>

            <p>Ahura Mazda taught that the mind is the first battle ground. Before any action is taken, before any word is spoken, there comes the thought. Those who would align with the divine must cultivate thoughts of truth—<em>knowing</em> rather than <em>believing falsely</em>, <em>hope</em> rather than <em>despair</em>, <em>service</em> rather than <em>greed</em>.</p>

            <div class="teaching-box">
                <strong>❖ Good Words (Hukata)</strong><br>
                "Speak only what is true, and speak truth with kindness. Your words have power—they build or destroy, heal or wound. The tongue is mightier than the sword because the sword only harms the body, but false words poison the soul."
            </div>

            <p>The Wise Lord understood that speech flows from thought. Those who master their thoughts will speak words of power and truth. A lie, no matter how small, creates a debt with the cosmos. But truth spoken with compassion becomes a bridge between souls and a reflection of the divine order.</p>

            <div class="teaching-box">
                <strong>❖ Good Deeds (Huvaršta)</strong><br>
                "Let your actions be aligned with truth. Feed the hungry, heal the sick, protect the weak, and tend the Fire. Every deed is a prayer written in the language of creation itself. The consequences of your actions ripple eternally through the cosmos."
            </div>

            <p>Thought and word must lead to action, or they are merely vapor in the wind. <strong>Real alignment with Ahura Mazda is demonstrated through deeds</strong>—works of creation rather than destruction, cultivation rather than ruin. To tend the animals, to work the earth, to maintain the Fire—these are not merely tasks, but sacred rituals that keep the cosmos in balance.</p>

            <div class="section-break">✧ The Law of Choice ✧</div>

            <p>Ahura Mazda revealed a truth that many mortals struggled to understand: <strong>He would not force the world to goodness</strong>. Angra Mainyu existed as a necessary counterforce—not to prove the existence of darkness, but to make possible the reality of choice.</p>

            <p>A universe without Angra Mainyu would be like a forest without storms—it would grow soft and decayed. A cosmos without darkness would have no meaning to light. <strong>True goodness can only exist in a world where evil is possible.</strong></p>

            <p>The Wise Lord taught that this very struggle is humanity's gift and burden—to stand at the crossroads in every moment and choose which force to align with, which voice to obey. In this choosing lies the deepest honor and the greatest responsibility.</p>

            <div class="teaching-box">
                <strong>❖ The Sacred Covenant</strong><br>
                "I do not ask you to be perfect. I ask you to choose well, as often as you can, with the knowledge and capacity you possess. Stumble, learn, rise again, and choose better. This is the path of a Keeper of the Flame."
            </div>

            <div class="section-break">✧ The Fire's Promise ✧</div>

            <p>Then Ahura Mazda spoke the final teaching—the one that would sustain humanity through all ages: <em>"The Fire I have given you is not merely physical flame. It is the warmth of compassion, the light of truth, and the breath of transformation. Tend it in your hearts, and it will never be extinguished."</em></p>

            <p>Those who understood this teaching became the first <strong>Keepers of the Flame</strong>—not priests or rulers, but awakened souls who carried the Sacred Fire in their consciousness and shared its warmth with all they encountered. They did not hoard the light but let it spread like embers on the wind.</p>

            <p>And Ahura Mazda promised: <em>"For as long as even one Keeper tends the Fire with a sincere heart, the cosmos will continue its eternal dance toward ultimate victory. The triumph of Asha (truth) over Druj (deception) is assured, though the struggle will be long and the price will be paid in effort and sacrifice."</em></p>

            <p>This is the wisdom that echoes through the ages—not comfort, but clarity. Not certainty of ease, but certainty of meaning. Not freedom from struggle, but freedom to choose one's response to struggle. And for those who would keep the Flame alive, this wisdom becomes a torch that lights the darkest paths.</p>
