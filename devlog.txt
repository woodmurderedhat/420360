[2025-04-11] Sidebar (Tarot Cards) Visibility Update:
- The tarot sidebar (#tarot-dock) is now hidden by default and only becomes visible after the game is started.
- When the game is over or before it starts, the sidebar remains hidden.
- This is managed by toggling the "hidden" class on #tarot-dock in src/game.js:
    - On game start: the "hidden" class is removed, showing the sidebar.
    - On game over: the "hidden" class is added, hiding the sidebar.
- The .hidden class is defined in style.css as "display: none !important;".
- In index.html, #tarot-dock starts with class="hidden" so it is not visible until the game begins.

Instructions:
- The sidebar with tarot cards will only be visible during active gameplay.
- Players will not see the tarot sidebar until they enter their name and start the game.
- When the game ends, the sidebar is hidden again.
