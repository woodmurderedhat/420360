Step 1: UI Enhancements
Responsive Design:

Ensure the game scales properly on all devices, including mobile and tablets.

Add a fullscreen toggle button for immersive gameplay.
Improved Visuals:

Add animations for piece movements and line clears.
Use gradient backgrounds and particle effects for a more dynamic look.
Highlight the active piece with a glowing border.
Accessibility:

Add ARIA roles and labels for better screen reader support.

Haptic Feedback:

For mobile users, add vibrations for key events (e.g., line clears or game over).
Step 5: Code Optimization

Use constants for repeated values (e.g., grid size, colors).
Error Handling:
