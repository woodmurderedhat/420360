# Casino Dice Game Mockup (Proof of Concept)

## 1. Overview
This mockup simulates the core mechanics of a decentralized Ethereum dice game casino. All logic is off-chain and for demonstration only. No real tokens or randomness are used.

This simulation supports up to 10 players and 10 bank investors (LPs) in a session. Each participant is tracked with a unique ID and balance.

## 2. Components
**Players:** Up to 10 players, each with a unique ID and wallet. Sim players can autobet (automatically place bets with preset or random strategies). Real players can adjust bet amounts manually and also participate as investors (LPs) by depositing into the bank.
**Bank (Liquidity Pool):** Tracks total liquidity, LP shares, and reserves for payouts.
**LPs (Liquidity Providers):** Up to 10 investors, each with a unique ID and wallet. Any player, including the real player, can also act as an LP by depositing funds into the pool. LPs can deposit or withdraw funds at any time (if liquidity allows) and earn a proportional share of player losses.
**Casino Owner:** Receives a fixed 1% fee on every bet.
**Randomness:** Simulated using pseudo-random numbers.

## 3. Game Flow
### 1. Player Bets
- Sim players can autobet: automatically place bets with preset or random strategies (e.g., fixed amount, martingale, random bet size).
- Real players can adjust bet amounts, odds, and chosen number manually, and can also invest in the bank as LPs.
- Each player has a wallet tracking their balance and bet history.
- 1% fee deducted and credited to owner.
- Remaining bet enters the game.
- Bank checks if it can cover max payout; rejects bet if not.

### 2. Simulated Dice Roll
- Generate pseudo-random number (1-100).
- If player wins, payout = bet × (1 - house edge) × odds.
- If player loses, loss distributed to LPs.

### 3. LP Mechanics
- Each LP has a wallet tracking their balance, deposits, withdrawals, and earnings.
- LPs can deposit funds to increase their share of the pool.
- LPs can withdraw funds at any time, provided the bank has sufficient liquidity after reserving for active bets.
- LPs earn proportional share of player losses, credited to their wallet.

## 4. Example Simulation
### Further Enhancements
- **Advanced Sim Strategies:**
  - Sim players can use advanced strategies (e.g., martingale, anti-martingale, stop-loss, profit target).
  - Strategy switching based on win/loss streaks or balance thresholds.
- **Risk Management:**
  - Configurable max bet limits per player and per round.
  - LPs can set withdrawal limits or lock-in periods.
  - Bank can enforce minimum reserve ratios to prevent insolvency.
- **Analytics & Reporting:**
  - Track win/loss streaks, average bet size, payout ratios, and LP earnings over time.
  - Visualize player and LP performance, bankroll trends, and system health.
- **Configurable Parameters:**
  - Owner/admin can adjust house edge, max bet, min deposit, and payout odds.
  - Real-time updates to game parameters for testing different scenarios.
- **Extensibility:**
  - Easily add new games (e.g., roulette, blackjack) with similar mechanics.
  - Support for multi-token betting and multi-currency LP pools.
  - Modular design for integrating real blockchain, randomness, and frontend UI.
### Additional Features
- Sim players can be configured with different betting strategies (e.g., fixed, random, progressive).
- Real players can interactively adjust bet amounts and strategies, and also invest in the bank as LPs.
- All wallets track transaction history for transparency.
- LP dashboard shows deposit/withdraw options, earnings, and share of pool.
- Owner dashboard shows total fees collected and system health.
### Multiple Players and LPs
#### Initial State
- Bank liquidity: 10,000 mock tokens
- LPs: 10 investors, each with a share (e.g., LP1: 20%, LP2: 10%, ..., LP10: 5%)
- Players: 10 players, each with a starting balance (e.g., 1,000 tokens)
- House edge: 2%

#### Simulation Flow
1. Each player can place a bet in turn (or randomly).
2. For each bet:
  - 1% fee deducted and credited to owner.
  - Bank checks if it can cover max payout; rejects bet if not.
  - Simulate dice roll and resolve outcome.
  - If player loses, loss distributed to all LPs proportionally.
  - If player wins, payout deducted from bank.
3. LPs can deposit/withdraw at any time (if liquidity allows).
4. Track balances for all players, LPs, and owner after each round.

## 5. Pseudo-code Example
# Example: Advanced sim player strategy (martingale)
class MartingalePlayer(Player):
  def __init__(self, pid, balance, base_bet):
    super().__init__(pid, balance, is_sim=True)
    self.base_bet = base_bet

# Example: Add analytics tracking

  bet_amount_net = bet_amount - fee
  owner_balance += fee
  max_payout = bet_amount_net * (1 - house_edge) * odds
  if bank_liquidity < max_payout:
    print(f"Bank cannot cover payout for player {player.id}")
    return
  roll = random.randint(1, 100)
  analytics['total_bets'] += 1
  if roll < roll_under:
    payout = bet_amount_net * (1 - house_edge) * odds
    player.wallet.balance += payout
    bank_liquidity -= payout
    player.wallet.history.append({'bet': bet_amount, 'result': 'win', 'payout': payout})
    analytics['total_wins'] += 1
    if hasattr(player, 'update_result'):
      player.update_result('win')
  else:
    player.wallet.balance -= bet_amount
    for i, lp in enumerate(lps):
      lp_gain = bet_amount_net * lp.share
      lp.wallet.balance += lp_gain
      analytics['lp_earnings'][i] += lp_gain
    bank_liquidity += bet_amount_net
    player.wallet.history.append({'bet': bet_amount, 'result': 'lose', 'loss': bet_amount})
    analytics['total_losses'] += 1
    if hasattr(player, 'update_result'):
      player.update_result('lose')

## 6. Frontend Mockup
* Display up to 10 players and 10 LPs with wallet balances, shares, and transaction history
* Sim players can autobet; real player can adjust bet amounts and strategies, and also invest/withdraw as an LP
* LP dashboard: deposit/withdraw, view earnings and wallet history for up to 10 investors
* Owner dashboard: view fees collected and system health

## 7. Limitations
* No real blockchain, tokens, or randomness
* For demonstration and testing only
* Can be extended to real smart contracts later
* Maximum 10 players and 10 LPs per simulation session
* Sim player strategies are basic and can be expanded
* Real player input simulated for demonstration
