- Fixed the gameboard so it no longer resizes with the screen. The Tetris board is now always 300x600px for consistent gameplay.
- Redesigned the sidebar (tarot dock) for desktop: it is now a sleek, fixed-width (260px) vertical sidebar with reduced padding, gap, and shadow. Tarot cards are more compact and the sidebar no longer crowds the gameboard.
- Adjusted #game-layout margin to align with the new sidebar width.

How to Play:
- Arrange falling tetromino pieces to form complete rows and clear lines.
- Use the arrow keys to move pieces left, right, and down.
- Use the up arrow or 'W' to rotate pieces.
- Press Shift to hold the current piece.
- Use number keys (1-6) to activate tarot cards for special abilities.
- The game speeds up as you progress. Plan your moves and use tarot cards strategically!
