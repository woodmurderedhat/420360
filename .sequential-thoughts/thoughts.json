There are multiple games in the /games directory\n4. I also see some content in /null-vesper which might be additional games or content\n5. There's an index.html that likely serves as the main page\n\nFor a comprehensive code audit, I need to:\n1. Identify all the games in the repository\n2. Examine each game's code structure\n3. Look for common issues like security vulnerabilities, performance problems, code quality issues\n4. Use the repl tools extensively as requested (10:1 ratio)\n5. Fix any issues found\n\nLet me start by cataloging all the games and understanding their structure.",

It's actually an event listener for the Escape key that dispatches events to parent frames. This is not a security issue, it's a legitimate UI feature. I should examine this more carefully to confirm.",

There's a comprehensive highscore system already built using HIGHSCORE_SYSTEM.md documentation\n2. The system has three main components:\n   - highscore-service.js (main service)\n   - highscore-integration.js (integration helper)\n   - global-leaderboard.js (UI component)\n\n3. From the code snippets, I can see that:\n   - The system is currently in \"fallbackMode = true\" using localStorage simulation\n   - There's Supabase configuration with URL and API key already present\n   - The comments mention \"In a real implementation, this would submit to Supabase\"\n   - There are methods like saveToGlobalStorage() that simulate database operations\n\n4. The issue seems to be that the system is not actually connecting to the real Supabase database, but is using localStorage as a simulation.\n\nLet me explore the repository structure first to understand the current state and then create a plan to implement real database integration.",
