- Fixed ghost piece logic: The ghost piece now copies all relevant properties from the current piece, uses the correct color with transparency, and only draws if not overlapping the current piece. This makes the landing preview accurate and visually consistent.
- Tarot effects are now robust: All time-based tarot effects (speed/coyoteTime) store and restore the previous value, preventing stacking bugs and ensuring correct effect durations. The Emperor card now works (random piece type logic added).
- See below for updated game instructions.

--- GAME INSTRUCTIONS ---

Tetris Controls:
- Arrow keys or WASD: Move and rotate the current piece.
- Shift: Hold the current piece.
- 1-6: Play the corresponding tarot card from your hand.

Ghost Piece:
- A semi-transparent "ghost" piece shows where your current piece will land if dropped. It updates in real time as you move or rotate the piece.

Tarot Cards:
- Tarot cards appear in your hand (max 6).
- Play a card by pressing 1-6 or clicking it.
- Each card has a unique effect (e.g., slow time, clear rows, bonus points).
- Time-based effects (speed/coyoteTime) now always restore the previous value after the effect ends, so effects do not stack incorrectly.

For more details on tarot effects, see the in-game card descriptions or src/tarot.js.
