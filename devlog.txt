- Added Board.moveRowsUp(count): Moves all rows up by the specified count, removing from the top and adding empty rows at the bottom.
- Added Board.addRandomGarbageRow(): Adds a random garbage row at the bottom with a single random hole, shifting the board up.
- Updated "The Devil" tarot effect: Now moves all rows up by 1–3 rows using moveRowsUp for robust behavior.
- Added "The Devil Reversed" tarot effect: Adds 1–3 random garbage rows at the bottom of the board, each with a random hole.
- All tarot effects now use robust board methods and are safeguarded against game over.

Instructions for new tarot effects:
- "The Devil": When played, all rows move up by 1–3 rows, making the board more difficult.
- "The Devil Reversed": When played, 1–3 random garbage rows (with a single hole each) are added at the bottom, pushing the board up and increasing the challenge.

All tarot effects are now robust and properly integrated. Effects that move lines up or add lines at the bottom work as intended.
