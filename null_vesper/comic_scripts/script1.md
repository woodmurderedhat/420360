**Comic Script: The Hollow Mirror - Issue #1: "Fragments"**

**PAGE 1 (5 Panels)**

**Panel 1:**

Wide shot of a ruined city skyline at dusk. Neo-Bratislava, crumbling towers, fractured roads, and flickering neon. A massive, cracked digital billboard reads: "PEACE IS MEMORY. MEMORY IS PEACE."

**CAPTION (NULL):**

There was no war. That’s what they remember.

**Panel 2:**

Interior. A crumbling apartment. Books, dataslates, memory drives. NULL VESPER, early 30s, cloaked, sits at a desk, half-lit by a blinking console. His cybernetic eye glows faintly.

**CAPTION (NULL):**

That’s what I made them remember.

**Panel 3:**

Close-up: Null inserts a small, glowing datachip labeled "EVENT 42-DELTA" into the console.

**SFX:** *click*

**Panel 4:**

Memory holograms flood the room—images of fire, crowds, soldiers. One scene flickers: Null standing amid chaos, arms outstretched.

**Panel 5:**

Null's reflection in a broken mirror beside the desk. His face appears fractured across the shards.

**CAPTION (NULL):**

But peace... peace is just a good story.

**PAGE 2 (4 Panels)**

**Panel 1:**

Flashback. University lecture hall, five years ago. Null (clean-shaven, youthful) stands before a class, projecting neural diagrams.

**NULL:**

If we change how we remember an act, do we change the morality of it?

**Panel 2:**

Student in the crowd: DR. ELEN RAA (20s, sharp-eyed, determined) raises her hand.

**RAA:**

Isn't that just rationalization?

**Panel 3:**

Null smiles, intrigued.

**NULL:**

Rationalization is the scaffolding of civilization.

**Panel 4:**

Outside the hall. Protesters shout as security drones float overhead. Banners: "TRUTH IS NOT A LUXURY."

**PAGE 3 (5 Panels)**

**Panel 1:**

Present day. A different location. Elen Raa, older, is in a dark archive chamber. She's holding a battered datachip. Her eyes are haunted.

**RAA (whisper):**

Event 42-Delta...

**Panel 2:**

She plugs the chip into an old viewer. The screen lights up: a massacre. Government troops opening fire.

**Panel 3:**

Same event, but it flickers—transforms into an image of peaceful negotiation. The memory is distorted.

**Panel 4:**

Raa stares, furious.

**RAA:**

You lied to the whole city.

**Panel 5:**

Flash cut to Null in the apartment. He suddenly turns his head, sensing something.

**CAPTION (NULL):**

Some memories fight back.

---

**PAGE 4 (Splash Page)**

Full-page: Null standing on the rooftop at night, looking out over Neo-Bratislava. The city is alive with fractured light. Holograms replay fake news footage. Whispers of conflicting memories float as ghostly speech bubbles across the sky.

**CAPTION (NULL):**

I used to believe in truth.

**CAPTION (NULL):**

Now I curate it.

---

**PAGE 5 (4 Panels)**

**Panel 1:**

Interior. Mirrorcell Sanctuary. Devotees in fractured masks chant silently around a holographic effigy of Null.

**CAPTION (NULL):**

They made me a myth...

**Panel 2:**

A devotee paints Null's likeness across a broken wall: eyes glowing, hands raised.

**CAPTION (NULL):**

...because I gave them a cleaner past.

**Panel 3:**

Back to Null's apartment. He watches old news reels that contradict each other.

**NULL (muttering):**

Which one was real?

Close-up of a photo: Null and Elen together, years ago. Torn in half.

**PAGE 6 (5 Panels)**

**Panel 1:**

Elen walks through a black market memory bazaar. Dealers sell curated flashbacks, emotional edits.

**DEALER:**

Got fresh filters—love affairs, heroics, your childhood how it should've been.

**Panel 2:**

Elen holds out a badge.

**RAA:**

Archivist Bureau. I want truth, not fantasy.

**Panel 3:**

Dealer sneers, gestures toward the back.

**DEALER:**

Only one seller deals in unfiltered cuts.

**Panel 4:**

A curtain pulls back, revealing a locked vault with Null's name etched in multiple languages.

**Panel 5:**

Close-up on Elen’s determined eyes.

**RAA:**

Time to reopen history.

**PAGE 7 (4 Panels)**

**Panel 1:**

Back to Null. He holds the original Event 42-Delta chip. Memories flash in his mind.

**Panel 2:**

His fingers hover over a device labeled: "REFRAME."

**NULL (thinking):**

Once I do it, there's no going back.

**Panel 3:**

He hesitates. Eye flickers. A whisper from the past:

**GHOST VOICE (RAA, OFF-PANEL):**

Truth matters, Null.

**Panel 4:**

He pulls back. The device powers down.

**NULL:**

Not this time.

Elen enters the vault. Inside: decaying servers, dripping data cables.

Holographic interface flickers on. A corrupted image of Null appears.

**ARCHIVIST THETA (AI):**

Welcome, seeker of untruths.

**Panel 3:**

Elen steps closer.

**RAA:**

Show me what he erased.

**Panel 4:**

The AI scans her. Systems whir.

**ARCHIVIST THETA:**

Redaction breach authorized.

**Panel 5:**

A screen begins to playback the true memory of Event 42-Delta.

**Panel 6:**

Her face freezes in horror.

**RAA (whisper):**

He didn’t rewrite it to hide his crimes...

---

**PAGE 9 (5 Panels)**

**Panel 1:**

Flashback inside the memory: Null tries to stop the government troops, pleading with them.

**NULL (MEMORY):**

Stand down! These people are unarmed!

**Panel 2:**

Troops ignore him. Gunfire erupts.

**Panel 3:**

Null cradles a wounded child in the chaos.

Close-up: his eye flickers. First unintentional use of power begins.

**Panel 1:**

Back to present. Null closes a case containing memory anchors.

**Panel 2:**

He walks to a rooftop ledge, watches citizens pass below.

They remember peace because I made it feel true.

Crowd below watches a memorial being lit. A holographic statue of a political leader is unveiled.

**Panel 4:**

Null looks down at a faded newspaper headline in his hand: "42 DEAD IN PEACE ACCORD CELEBRATION."

---

**PAGE 11 (5 Panels)**

**Panel 1:**

Elen exits the vault. The weight of knowledge shows in her posture.

**Panel 2:**

She uploads the footage to a secure channel. Labels it: "UNREVISED TRUTH."

**Panel 3:**

A drone observes her from above.

**Panel 4:**

The video upload halts. ERROR screen.

**Panel 5:**

In the shadows, a masked Mirrorcell agent smiles.

**AGENT (whisper):**

Some truths were meant to die.

---

**PAGE 12 (Splash Page)**

Full-page: Null Vesper walks away from the rooftop ledge. Behind him, ghostly versions of his past selves trail off into the sky—each with a different memory, a different truth.

**CAPTION (NULL):**

What they remember matters more than what I did.

**CAPTION (NULL):**

That’s the burden of reframing.

**TO BE CONTINUED...**
