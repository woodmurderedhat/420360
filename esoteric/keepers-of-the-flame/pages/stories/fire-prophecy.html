            <strong>⭐ Unlocked at:</strong> 7-Day Flame Streak<br>
            <strong>🎯 Story Type:</strong> Sacred Prophecy<br>
            <strong>📖 Reading Time:</strong> ~10 minutes
        </div>

        <div class="story-content">
            <p>There exists in the sacred texts a prophecy of such power and beauty that it has sustained Keepers of the Flame through the darkest ages. This is not a prophecy of doom, though darkness is spoken of. Nor is it a guarantee of ease, though ultimate victory is assured. Rather, it is a vision that transforms how a Keeper understands their place in the cosmos.</p>

            <p>In his final teachings, Zarathustra revealed to his most devoted disciples a vision he had received in meditation—a vision of time unfolding across vast ages, each marked by distinct characteristics, each bringing humanity closer to a moment of supreme transformation.</p>

            <div class="section-break">✧ The Three Thousand-Year Ages ✧</div>

            <p>The vision showed time divided into periods called <strong>Gahanbars</strong>—sacred seasons of thousands of years. In each age, a different quality of struggle manifests, and a different type of Keeper is needed.</p>

            <div class="prophecy-box">
                <strong>The First Age: The Age of Confusion</strong><br>
                In this age, humanity awakens but remains largely asleep. Many voices claim to speak truth, but few actually do. The ignorant outnumber the wise. Kings and priests grow more corrupt, using religion as a tool of control. Evil spreads openly, unashamed. But the Sacred Fire still burns in hidden places, tended by those brave enough to keep it alive despite persecution. This is the age of the Keepers of Shadows—those who preserve truth in darkness.
            </div>

            <div class="prophecy-box">
                <strong>The Second Age: The Age of Mixture</strong><br>
                In this age, truth and deception become so intertwined that few can distinguish one from the other. False prophets arise, preaching twisted versions of the ancient wisdom. Wars are fought in the name of righteousness. Empires rise claiming to protect the Sacred Fire while perverting it entirely. The corruption becomes so complete that many Keepers despair, believing the darkness has won. But in this very age, from unexpected places, new voices arise—Keepers of Integration who can pierce through the confusion and recover authentic truth from beneath layers of falsehood.
            </div>

            <div class="prophecy-box">
                <strong>The Third Age: The Age of Awakening</strong><br>
                In this age, humanity begins to awaken in earnest. The illusions start to crumble. Keepers emerge openly, no longer needing to hide. The Sacred Fire spreads from place to place, and more and more people recognize its truth. This is the age of the Keepers of Recognition—those who openly teach and transform the collective consciousness of humanity.
            </div>

            <div class="section-break">✧ The Saoshyant—The World-Saving Deliverer ✧</div>

            <p>But the prophecy goes even deeper. It speaks of a moment at the end of the final age when <strong>Saoshyant</strong> will arise—not necessarily a single person, but rather a quality of consciousness and action that emerges when humanity has finally purified itself sufficiently.</p>

            <p>Zarathustra taught that this Saoshyant represents the <em>awakened potential within the human race itself</em>. It is not an external savior who will do the work for us, but rather the realization that humanity itself possesses the capacity to transform the world.</p>

            <div class="prophecy-box">
                <strong>The Coming of Saoshyant</strong><br>
                "When the Fire has been tended faithfully through all ages, when enough souls have chosen truth despite suffering, when the cosmic balance tips toward the good, then will arise the final Deliverer. Not one who will destroy the world, but one who will transform it. The dead will be raised. Time itself will be renewed. Evil will be defeated not through obliteration but through the complete transformation of all beings into alignment with the divine will."
            </div>

            <p>This is perhaps the most radical aspect of the prophecy: <strong>even Angra Mainyu, the Destructive Spirit, will not be eternally destroyed but rather will be transformed.</strong> Evil exists not as an eternal cosmic principle but as a temporary manifestation of disconnection from truth. When all beings are sufficiently awakened, evil becomes impossible—not through suppression, but through the transcendence of the conditions that make it possible.</p>

            <div class="section-break">✧ The Frashokereti—The Final Renovation ✧</div>

            <p>The culmination of the prophecy is called the <strong>Frashokereti</strong>, or Final Renovation. This is not an apocalypse in the destructive sense, but rather a cosmic spring-cleaning, a renewal of all creation through the purifying fire of truth.</p>

            <div class="prophecy-box">
                <strong>The Vision of Frashokereti</strong><br>
                "The Sacred Fire will consume all falsehood—not in an instant, but as a gradual transformation. Mountains will crumble and be reformed, renewed. Waters will rise and return. The earth will become level and fertile beyond measure. Animals will lose their aggression and become companions. Humans will no longer hunger, thirst, or suffer illness. All discord will cease. And all beings—the living, the dead, the human, the divine—will exist in perfect harmony, eternally renewed."
            </div>

            <p>But here is what makes this prophecy so powerful for the Keepers: <strong>this transformation is not something that will happen to us, but something that happens through us.</strong> Every choice toward truth, every act of creation, every moment of compassion is a contribution to this ultimate transformation.</p>

            <p>The prophecy teaches that we are not passive observers waiting for history to unfold. We are <em>agents of transformation</em>. The Final Renovation begins now, in this moment, wherever a Keeper chooses to align with truth instead of falsehood, creation instead of destruction.</p>

            <div class="section-break">✧ The Present Moment's Significance ✧</div>

            <p>The most profound aspect of this prophecy is how it reframes the present moment. Whether we live in the First Age, the Second Age, or the Third Age is, in a sense, irrelevant to the individual Keeper. <strong>Every Keeper, in every age, has the same sacred task: to tend the Fire, to choose truth, and to contribute to the victory of good.</strong></p>

            <p>The Keepers of old did not wait for the Final Renovation to manifest goodness. They did not postpone their commitment to truth waiting for a future age of awakening. They acted now, in their time, with the understanding that every moment contains within it the potential for ultimate transformation.</p>

            <p>This is the deepest comfort of the Fire Prophecy: <strong>you are living in the most important age—not because of when you were born, but because the only time that exists is now, and in this now, your choices matter infinitely.</strong></p>
