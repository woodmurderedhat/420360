        <div class="overview">
            <h3>Beyond the Basics</h3>
            <p>The basic meditation practices (foundational meditations on the sephiroth, the Middle Pillar, etc.) form the essential ground. Advanced practices build upon this foundation to develop extraordinary states of consciousness. These practices require:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>At least 6 months of foundational meditation experience</li>
                <li>Completion of the basic grade practices</li>
                <li>A commitment to daily practice (30+ minutes minimum)</li>
                <li>A teacher or guide (highly recommended)</li>
                <li>Psychological stability and emotional grounding</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="meditation-box">
            <div class="meditation-title">1. The Kabbalistic Cross Meditation (Advanced)</div>
            <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 20 minutes | <strong>Frequency:</strong> Daily or 3-4x weekly</p>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Establish unshakeable connection to the Divine source through all four bodies (physical, astral, mental, spiritual).</p>
            <p><strong>Practice:</strong> Stand in the center of your sacred space. With each touch to your body during the Qabalistic Cross, expand your visualization:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Forehead (Atah):</strong> Visualize infinite white light descending from the Godhead</li>
                <li><strong>Chest (Malkuth):</strong> Feel grounded in the physical world while crowned with divinity</li>
                <li><strong>Right Shoulder (Geburah):</strong> Feel the fire of divine will and strength</li>
                <li><strong>Left Shoulder (Gedulah):</strong> Feel the infinite expansion of divine mercy and grace</li>
                <li><strong>Hands at Heart (le-olam, Amen):</strong> Feel all four dimensions unified within your heart</li>
            </ul>
            This simple gesture becomes a gateway to transcendent consciousness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="meditation-box">
            <div class="meditation-title">2. The Microcosm-Macrocosm Meditation</div>
            <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 25-30 minutes | <strong>Frequency:</strong> 3-4x weekly</p>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Attain direct experience of the Hermetic axiom "As above, so below; as without, so within."</p>
            <p><strong>Practice:</strong> Begin with the Middle Pillar. Then expand your visualization:
            <ul>
                <li>See yourself as a microcosm containing the entire macrocosm</li>
                <li>Your head contains all the stars and celestial bodies</li>
                <li>Your chest contains the entire solar system</li>
                <li>Your belly contains all the planets and elements</li>
                <li>Your feet contain the center of the earth</li>
                <li>You are simultaneously tiny and infinite, contained and containing all</li>
            </ul>
            This dissolves the illusion of separation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="meditation-box">
            <div class="meditation-title">3. The Path-Working Meditation (Intermediate-Advanced)</div>
            <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 30-45 minutes | <strong>Frequency:</strong> 1-2x weekly</p>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Travel the paths of the Tree of Life in consciousness, meeting the forces and beings that dwell there.</p>
            <p><strong>Practice:</strong> After establishing yourself in Malkuth through the Middle Pillar, visualize a path before you leading to another sephira. Walk this path mentally, noting symbols, colors, beings, and messages. Arrive at the destination sephira and spend time there. Return by the same path. Record all experiences. With practice, these become fully immersive experiences.</p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Advanced practitioners may encounter real inner planes inhabitants. Maintain proper respect and boundaries.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="meditation-box">
            <div class="meditation-title">4. The Void Meditation (Advanced-Master)</div>
            <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 20-40 minutes | <strong>Frequency:</strong> 2-3x weekly</p>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Attain the "peace that passeth understanding"—consciousness beyond all form and concept.</p>
            <p><strong>Practice:</strong> After the Middle Pillar, release all visualization. Release all thought. Release all sense of time, space, self. Dwell in emptiness—not negatively but as infinite potential. Rest there for as long as it comes naturally. This is meditation without object. This is the most profound attainment.</p>
            <p><strong>Warning:</strong> This practice can be destabilizing if attempted without proper grounding. Always return by performing the Middle Pillar afterwards and grounding physically.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="meditation-box">
            <div class="meditation-title">5. The Divine Name Vibration (Intermediate-Advanced)</div>
            <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 20-30 minutes | <strong>Frequency:</strong> Daily</p>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Attune your consciousness directly to Divine frequency through sacred sound.</p>
            <p><strong>Practice:</strong> Choose a Divine Name corresponding to your current work (e.g., "Eheieh" for Kether, "Elohim Tzabaoth" for Hod, etc.). Sit in meditation and vibrate this name aloud, extending it over the length of your breath:
            <ul>
                <li>Feel the vibration resonate through your entire being</li>
                <li>See the corresponding sephira blazing with its color</li>
                <li>Attune your consciousness to the frequency of that name</li>
                <li>After 15-20 minutes, release the name and rest in silence</li>
            </ul>
            This is one of the most powerful practices in Hermetic work.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="meditation-box">
            <div class="meditation-title">6. The Heart-Self Meditation (Master Practice)</div>
            <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 30-45 minutes | <strong>Frequency:</strong> 2-3x weekly or daily</p>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Attain continuous awareness of your True Self dwelling in Tiphareth (the heart).</p>
            <p><strong>Practice:</strong> Establish the Middle Pillar with strong focus on Tiphareth (golden sphere at the heart). Rest your attention there. Beyond all thought, all emotion, all sensation—become aware of your witnessing consciousness. This is the "I AM" that observes all experience. Rest as this consciousness. This is enlightenment.</p>
            <p><strong>Advanced:</strong> Eventually, this witnessing awareness becomes permanent. You are always aware of your True Self even during daily activities. This is the attainment of the Philosophus grade.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="meditation-box">
            <div class="meditation-title">7. The Merkabah Ascent (Master Level)</div>
            <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 45-60+ minutes | <strong>Frequency:</strong> 1-2x monthly</p>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Ascend through the sephiroth and planes of existence to attain union with the Godhead.</p>
            <p><strong>Practice:</strong> Begin in Malkuth. Ascend through Yesoid (astral planes), Hod (rational mind), Netzach (emotional body), Tiphareth (true self). Continue through Geburah and Chokmah. Finally approach Kether, the Crown—the source. At Kether, all separation dissolves. You return changed.</p>
            <p><strong>This is the ultimate meditation practice—a complete journey through all levels of consciousness.</strong></p>

            <h3>Important Guidelines for Advanced Practice</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Integration:</strong> After intense meditation, spend 15 minutes in gentle grounding. Drink water. Eat something. Move your body.</li>
                <li><strong>Journal:</strong> Record all experiences while they are fresh. Patterns will emerge over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Teacher Guidance:</strong> If experiences become overwhelming or confused, seek guidance from an experienced teacher.</li>
                <li><strong>Psychological Health:</strong> If you have a history of dissociation, psychosis, or severe trauma, proceed carefully. These practices can amplify existing conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Balance:</strong> Advanced meditation must be balanced with grounding, service, and ordinary life engagement.</li>
                <li><strong>Respect:</strong> You are accessing real dimensions of consciousness. Treat all encounters with respect and maintain proper boundaries.</li>
            </ul>
