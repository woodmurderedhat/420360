The 420360 blog is now live! This markdown-based blogging system is simple yet powerful, letting you focus on writing great content without complicated interfaces.

## How It Works

This blog system is incredibly straightforward:

1. **Write in Markdown** - Create `.md` files in the `_posts/` directory
2. **Add Frontmatter** - Include metadata at the top of your post
3. **Automatic Publishing** - Push to GitHub, your post appears automatically!

## Frontmatter Format

Each post starts with frontmatter (YAML format):

```
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: 2024-12-19
author: Your Name
categories: category
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
---
```

### Frontmatter Fields:
- **title** - The post title (required)
- **date** - Publication date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- **author** - Your name or pseudonym (optional)
- **categories** - Single category for organization (optional)
- **tags** - Array of tags for topic organization (optional)

## Markdown Features Supported

Your posts support full markdown:

- **Headers**: `# H1`, `## H2`, `### H3`
- **Bold**: `**text**` or `__text__`
- **Italic**: `*text*` or `_text_`
- **Code**: `` `inline code` `` and ` ```code blocks``` `
- **Links**: `[text](url)`
- **Lists**: `- item`
- **Blockquotes**: `> quote`
